## How it works

A D flip-flop works by taking the value on its input (D) and transferring it to its output (Q) only on the active edge of the clock signal. When the clock edge occurs, the flip-flop “samples” the input and holds that value steady until the next clock event, regardless of how the input changes afterward. If a reset signal is present, it forces the output to a known state, usually zero. This behavior makes the D flip-flop a fundamental building block for storing and sequencing data in digital systems.
